      <description>If we ever sit down and try to think what influence indian culture has on us or me, we won&amp;rsquo;t be able to trace it because our culture is so random and diverse. Our heritage is so diverse. There are so many variable whose combination lets us create so many different combinations of cultures and Heritages. At the same time it is so local that whatever surrounds us, we take it as our culture, most of the we are not even thinking as what we do is even remotely related to other parts of the country.</description>
