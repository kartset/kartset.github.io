          <p>If we ever sit down and try to think what influence indian culture has on us or me, we won&rsquo;t be able to trace it because our culture is so random and diverse. Our heritage is so diverse. There are so many variable whose combination lets us create so many different combinations of cultures and Heritages. At the same time it is so local that whatever surrounds us, we take it as our culture, most of the we are not even thinking as what we do is even remotely related to other parts of the country. Plus the definition of what Indian culture is different for different people. I did my schooling in one state, I did my undergraduate in another state, and currently pursuing my post graduation in another state and I belong to another state. Now as I moved in my life to other states I carried everything which I adopted from those states. So now my exposure to India is more than my parents so the definition of Indian culture is more generic for me in comparison to my parents. So now when I&rsquo;ll be doing a job most probably I&rsquo;ll be in another state and what if after marriage I end up settling down in another state. So when I&rsquo;ll be living there it won&rsquo;t be just me it&rsquo;ll be all those things that I adopted and will be passing down to future generations as well. Our country is so diverse that our languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and customs differ from place to place. And when we come to think of it, what we think is our culture and heritage is also an amalgamation of all the things that has happened in this subcontinent in the past years. Every ruler, explorer, invader brought in something for the place he came. So what we things as ours is because we born right into it. Every variable in the culture which stood the test of time and survived, we are following it every thing which couldn&rsquo;t is let go of. So when you ask me what is the influence of Indian culture on me, I don&rsquo;t what are you talking about. Because it is not something which is static, it is very dynamic. It changes with time, place, requirement, ease. For eg the city of kota in rajasthan, the eating habits of the city is much in resemblance with the neighborhood state of Madhya Pradesh instead of Rajasthan. Same is with jodhpur but instead of Madhya Pradesh it&rsquo;s gujarat in that case. We have a large spectrum for everything that constitutes our life. From the things we believe in to the things we eat, everything changes every 100 kms. There is one thing which doesn&rsquo;t change every 100 Kms with all these variables, there&rsquo;s one thing which is very intrinsic to the indians, there is one thing which is constant and that is the concept of unity in diversity. We all are same deep down. We all are so diverse yet stand united. Of there are variables, there will be constants as well. There&rsquo;s always two sides to a coin.  We all sing the same national anthem. So there has to be things which put their influences on us. So if we observe we find it everywhere, even if we travel the lengths and breaths of the country these are the few things that we can find in The Great Indian Cultures. We all are festive, we all celebrate, we all are inclusive, we all are generous, we all are open hearted, we all are candid. In the end our culture influences us to be a good happy person. We don&rsquo;t know how to live profitably. All we know is how to live righteously.</p>
